# Cnake
A recreation of *Snake* from scratch using **C++** 

Rather than using SDL2 or SFML or other Window/Rendering libraries, this project directly interfaces with the Windows Platform API, creating all the necessary engine components from scratch.

## What's included
Internal implementation of window management, rendering pipeline, input handling and of course, game logic.
